    "We release the *FINN.no recommender systems slate dataset* to improve recommender systems research.\n",
    "The dataset includes both search and recommendation interactions between users and the platform over a 30 day period.\n",
    "The dataset has logged both exposures and clicks, *including interactions where the user did not click on any of the items in the slate*.\n",
    "To our knowledge there exist no such large-scale dataset, and we hope this contribution can help researchers constructing improved models and improve offline evaluation metrics.\n",

    "## Organization\n",
    "The repository is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The dataset is placed in (`data/`).\n",
    "- The code open sourced from the article [\"Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046) is found in (`code/`). However, we are in the process of making the data more generally available which makes the code incompatible with the current (newer) version of the data. Please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0) for a compatible version of the code and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download and prepare dataset\n",
    "The data files can either be obtained by cloning this repository with git lfs, or (preferably) use the [datahelper.download_data_files()](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/blame/transform-to-numpy-arrays/datahelper.py#L3) function which downloads the same dataset from google drive.\n",
    "For pytorch users, they can directly use the `dataset_torch.load_dataloaders()` to get ready-to-use dataloaders for training, validation and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart dataset [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/blob/master/quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb)\n",
    "We provide a quickstart jupyter notebook that runs on Google Colab (quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb) which includes all necessary steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: This quickstart notebook is currently incompatible with the main branch. \n",
    "We will update the notebook as soon as we have published a pip-package. In the meantime, please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations\n",
    "This repository accompany the paper [\"Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046) by Simen Eide, David S. Leslie and Arnoldo Frigessi.\n",
    "The article is under review, and the pre-print can be obtained [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use either the code, data or paper, please consider citing the paper.\n",

    "# Todo\n",
    "This repository is currently *work in progress*, and we will provide descriptions and tutorials. Suggestions and contributions to make the material more available is welcome.\n",
    "There are some features of the repository that we are working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Release the dataset as numpy objects instead of pytorch arrays. This will help non-pytorch users to more easily utilize the data\n",
    "- [x] Maintain a pytorch dataset for easy usage\n",
    "- [ ] Create a pip package for easier installation and usage. the package should download the dataset using a function.\n",
    "- [ ] Make the quickstart guide compatible with the pip package and numpy format.\n",
    "- [ ] Add easily useable functions that compute relevant metrics such as hitrate, log-likelihood etc.\n",
    "- [ ] Distribute the data on other platforms such as kaggle.\n",
    "- [ ] Add a short description of the data in the readme.md directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the current state is in early stage, it makes sense to allow the above changes non-backward compatible. \n",
    "However, this should be completed within the next couple of months.\n"
