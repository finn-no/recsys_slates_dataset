    "## Organization\n",
    "The repository is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The dataset is placed in `data/` and stored using git-lfs. We also provide an automatic download function in the pip package (preferred usage).\n",
    "- The code open sourced from the article [\"Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046) is found in (`code_eide_et_al21/`). However, we are in the process of making the data more generally available which makes the code incompatible with the current (newer) version of the data. Please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0) for a compatible version of the code and dataset.\n",

    "We provide a quickstart jupyter notebook that runs on Google Colab (quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb) which includes all necessary steps above.\n",
    "It gives a quick introduction to how to use the dataset.\n",

    "## Todo\n",
    "This repository is currently *work in progress*, and we will provide descriptions and tutorials. Suggestions and contributions to make the material more available is welcome.\n",
    "There are some features of the repository that we are working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Release the dataset as numpy objects instead of pytorch arrays. This will help non-pytorch users to more easily utilize the data\n",
    "- [x] Maintain a pytorch dataset for easy usage\n",
    "- [x] Create a pip package for easier installation and usage. the package should download the dataset using a function.\n",
    "- [x] Make the quickstart guide compatible with the pip package and numpy format.\n",
    "- [ ] The git lfs is currently broken by removing some lines in .gitattributes that is in conflict with nbdev. The dataset is still usable using the building download functions as they use a different source. However, we should fix this. An issue is [posted on nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues/506).\n",
    "- [ ] Add easily useable functions that compute relevant metrics such as hitrate, log-likelihood etc.\n",
    "- [ ] Distribute the data on other platforms such as kaggle.\n",
    "- [ ] Add a short description of the data in the readme.md directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the current state is in early stage, it makes sense to allow the above changes non-backward compatible. \n",
    "However, this should be completed within the next couple of months."
